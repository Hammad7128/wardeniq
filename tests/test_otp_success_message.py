"""Regression coverage for the OTP-login false-success-message bug.

QA report: "incorrect Success Message Displayed When OTP Email Fails to Send" —
entering a (syntactically valid) email and clicking Send Code shows a success
message even though no OTP email ever arrives.

Root cause: `request_otp()` has three legitimate anti-enumeration / anti-abuse
branches — unrecognized email, deactivated account, rate-limited account — that
deliberately never attempt delivery and return the *same* `{"sent": True}` shape
a real send returns (so the endpoint can't be used to probe which accounts
exist or are being throttled; this masking itself is correct and intentional,
matching the pattern already used a few routes down in
`request_password_reset()`). The bug is narrower: the response carried no signal
that anything was skipped, and the frontend's hardcoded "Code sent. Check your
inbox." text is only true for a *real* send — so testers who (very naturally)
tried the flow with an email that wasn't already a registered, active account
saw an unconditional success claim and, correctly, no email.

The fix adds an honest, non-committal `message` field ("If an account exists
...") to every masked branch, and has the frontend prefer `r.message` over its
old hardcoded string. `sent` stays `True` and no branch is distinguishable from
another by response *shape* — only by wording that itself reveals nothing — so
the anti-enumeration property this code exists for is unaffected.

These tests call `request_otp()` directly (same FakeStore-monkeypatch pattern as
test_rbac_auth.py::TestSmtpAndPasswordLogin), not through a live server, but
they exercise the real function body end-to-end for each branch, including
confirming `_deliver_otp` is never invoked when nothing should be sent.
